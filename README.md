## Radial Interstices Enable Speedy Low-Volume imagING

This is a reconstruction toolbox optimised for 3D non-cartesian MR images. There are many high quality MR recon toolboxes
available, e.g. [BART](http://mrirecon.github.io/bart/), but these are mostly optimised for 2D sequences. 3D non-cartesian
sequences present unique challenges for efficient reconstruction, so we wrote our own.

This toolbox was presented at ISMRM 2020.

## Installation

Pre-compiled executables are provided for Linux and Mac OS X in a .tar.gz 
archive from http://github.com/spinicist/riesling/releases. Download the 
archive and extract it with `tar -xzf riesling-platform.tar.gz`. Then, move the 
resulting `riesling` executable to somewhere on your `$PATH`, for instance 
`/usr/local/bin`. That's it.

- MacOS Catalina or higher users should use `curl` to download the binary, i.e. 
  `curl -L https://github.com/spinicist/riesling/releases/download/v1.0/riesling-macos.tar.gz`. 
  This is because Safari now sets the quarantine attribute of all downloads, 
  which prevents them being run as the binary is unsigned. It is possible to 
  remove the quarantine flag with `xattr`, but downloading with `curl` is more 
  straightforward.
- The Linux executable is compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 and a statically linked
  libstdc++. This means it will hopefully run on most modern Linux
  distributions. Let us know if it doesn't.
- The Mac executable is compiled with MacOS 14.

## Usage

RIESLING comes as a single executable file with multiple commands, similar to 
`git` or `bart`. Type `riesling` to see a list of all the available commands. If
you run a RIESLING command without any additional parameter RIESLING will output
all available options for the given command.

RIESLING uses HDF5 (.h5) files for input and output. Your input file will need
to contain the non-cartesian data, the non-cartesian trajectory, and the image
geometry/orientation information. Some helper functions are provided for
creating a suitable .h5 file from Python or Matlab. These are in the repository
but not included as part of the installation - you will need to download and
install these yourself.

Once you have assembled the input dataset, the first command you should start
with is `riesling recon-lsq`. This will perform a least-squares reconstruction
of the data using a pre-conditioned iterative algorithm. If the resulting
image looks good, then the `recon-rlsq` command contains options for a
regularized least-squares reconstruction (e.g. Total Variation or Total
Generalized Variation).

To view the output images in `.h5` format requires an HDF5 viewer, for instace
the H5Web plugin for VSCode. If you compile `riesling` yourself the `montage`
command can show images in your terminal. Otherwise the `nii` command will
convert from riesling format to Nifti. 

A separate examples repository https://github.com/spinicist/riesling-examples
contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating most functionality.

you can open an [issue](https://github.com/spinicist/riesling/issues), or

## Compilation

If you wish to compile RIESLING yourself, compilation should hopefully be 
straightforward as long as you have access to a C++20 compiler (GCC 10 or
higher, Clang 7 or higher). RIESLING relies on `vcpkg` for dependency
management. To download and compile RIESLING, follow these steps:

### 0. MacOS Dependencies
Install the [MacOS vcpkg dependencies](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#installing-macos-developer-tools).

1. XCode from the AppStore
2. Run `$ xcode-select --install` in the terminal

You may also need to install `pkg-config` depending on your macOS version. This
is easily installed with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using
```
$ brew install pkg-config
```

Apple Silicon (M1) is supported.

### 0. Linux Dependencies
Install the [Linux vcpkg dependencies](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#installing-linux-developer-tools).
These include `cmake`, `tar`, `curl`, `zip`, `unzip`, `pkg-config` \& `build-essential`.
You may be surprised by which distributions do not include these by default.

### 1. Clone repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/spinicist/riesling
```

### 2. Compile
In the `riesling` folder execute
```
$ ./bootstrap.sh
```
